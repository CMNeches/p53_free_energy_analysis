# p53_free_energy_analysis
This repository contains an expansion of my study The Identification and Analysis of Novel TP53 Hotspots and p53 Protein Structures (pending publication).  This contains the code I used to analyze the free energy of the mutant p53 proteins produced by TP53 hotspot mutations.  It also contains two comprehensive p53 databases - one for germline mutations, and one for somatic mutations.

For the code from my prior study, please visit this link:  https://github.com/CMNeches/p53_hotspots_structures
